# Caution
This toolhead is still under development and has not yet been tested for stability.   
I am trying to design a better toolhead, but something could go wrong and your 3D printer could break.

# Features
- Short distance from the linear rail to the nozzle.
- Light weight. (290g or less)
- Optimized airflow.
- 5020 blower fan. (parts cooling)
- Built-in retractable Z-probe.
- Silent

# Parts Printing
- Layer height 0.2mm, Extrusion width 0.4mm, Wall count 4, Top/Bottom layers 8, Infill 40%.
- Lightness and strength are prioritized over ease of printing, so most parts require support.
- Select ServoHorn2.2gA(B).stl and ServoHorn2gA(B).stl according to your servo motor
- Servo horns A and B differ in thickness by 0.2 mm. Select the one that fits.
- Body parts(BodyLeft.stl, BodyRight.stl) are difficult to print, so some are pre-supported. Choose your preference.
